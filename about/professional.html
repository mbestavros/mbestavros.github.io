                            since October 2018, when I joined as a part-time intern while finishing up my graduate
                            studies at Boston University. I moved to full-time in June 2019.</h3>
                        <h3 class="resume-card__subtitle mdc-typography mdc-typography--body1">I'm part of the Office of the
                            CTO's Emerging Technologies group, working on the Security team. Our job is to identify nascent
                            open-source security projects with long-term strategic value to Red Hat and bootstrap them into
                            successful upstream communities.</h3>
                        <h3 class="resume-card__subtitle mdc-typography mdc-typography--body1">In recent times, we've had a
                            particularly strong focus on software supply chain security. Our team helped co-found the very trendy <a href="https://www.sigstore.dev/">Sigstore</a> project (which you can read about on my blog <a href="https://mark.bestavros.net/blog/sigstore-in-a-nutshell/">here!</a>), and we've been primary contributors to the <a href="https://github.com/keylime/keylime">Keylime</a> project since its inception. I've done work with both these efforts during my recent time at Red Hat. In the past, I've also contributed to the <a href="https://enarx.dev/">Enarx</a> project.</h3>
