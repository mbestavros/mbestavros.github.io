# When in California...

... do as the Californians do. (Drive. A lot. Too much for this rail-obsessed Bostonian.)

A few weeks ago, during the week of October 10-16, I traveled to LA for Kubecon 2021. I wrote a journal about my experience at the conference itself, which you can read [here](https://mark.bestavros.net/blog/kubecon-2021-diary/) if you're interested.

Of course, I got up to quite a bit more than talking to cloud-native nerds for a whole week: I was in LA! There was so much to do there, and I tried to make the most of my off-hours. Most of these experiences are best shared through photography, so this entry will be pretty light on writing and heavy on pictures. I hope you enjoy looking through them!

## Sunday: the Griffith Observatory

Located in the hills above LA, the Griffith likely has the best views of the city - especially at night, when Jyotsna (my colleague and travel buddy for the week) and I visited.

But the _piece de resistance_ of the night has to be this shot of the moon I captured using one of the observatory's free-to-use telescopes:

If I ever come back to LA, the Griffith will definitely be on my itinerary.

## Tuesday: the Petersen Automotive Museum

Readers, I'm a bit of a contradiction: a transit-obsessed car nerd. I do not want to own a car if I can help it. I do not want to deal with traffic. I do not want to contribute to climate change. Yet, at the same time, if you put me in front of a fancy sports car, I'll be drooling with joy.

In fact, that's what I did with my Tuesday afternoon: I visited the Petersen Automotive Museum! For five glorious hours, I geeked out over some truly incredible machines - and I took lots of pictures. Here are some of my favorites, sorted by exhibits. (If you're not interested in cars, feel free to skip this section - I put _a lot_ in here.)

### Supercars

I went through the museum top to bottom, and the top floor is all supercars. And when the very first thing you see is a Countach, you know you're in for a treat.

<div class="card-local-media">
{% responsiveImage, "content/personal/la-petersen-countach.jpg", "" %}
</div>

This gorgeous thing is a road-going GT40 MkIII from 1966, right in the middle of their Le Mans dominance. (Even if you're a normal person, you should watch Ford vs Ferrari.)

<div class="card-local-media">
{% responsiveImage, "content/personal/la-petersen-gt40.jpg", "" %}
</div>

Speaking of Ferrari, here are two of them! An F40 and Enzo back to back.

<div class="card-local-media">
{% responsiveImage, "content/personal/la-petersen-ferraris.jpg", "" %}
</div>

A wall of '80s and '90s (and some '00s) icons! From left to right: the Porsche 959, RUF CTR Yellowbird, Vector W8, Honda NSX, Jaguar XJ220, Saleen S7, and Maserati MC12. Not pictured, but still present: BMW M1, Lancia Stratos, and Lamborghini Miura. A number of these cars, at one point or another, have held the record for fastest road-legal car in the world.

<div class="card-local-media">
{% responsiveImage, "content/personal/la-petersen-lineup.jpg", "" %}
</div>

The next few are not technically part of the exhibit (they're in the museum's entrance hallway) but they certainly qualify as supercars: a McLaren F1 GTR from Le Mans in the late '90s, and a pair of Ford GTs. I like 'em all, so they're going in!

### Formula 1

I'm a newly-minted F1 fan (thanks, Drive to Survive!), so this exhibit was particularly cool for me. There's archival footage of the exhibit's cars actually racing in the background, set to the glorious soundtrack of screaming F1 engines. It's an amazing experience. Check this one out if you go.

<div class="card-local-media">
{% responsiveImage, "content/personal/la-petersen-f1-center.jpg", "" %}
</div>

Some standouts from the '90s, including the iconic McLaren livery of the era.

<div class="card-local-media">

And a few from the 2010s, including a few very recent!

</div>

### Porsche 962

The Petersen has an entire exhibit designated to the Porsche 962, a Le Mans racecar from the `80s into the early '90s. It's a very sleek and clean exhibit with lots of different liveries.

<div class="card-local-media">

</div>

<div class="card-local-media">

</div>

This is also the only time I thought to ask someone to take a picture of me the whole day, so... here I am!

### James Bond

Last, but most certainly not least, the James Bond exhibit. Need I say more? No - but I will show you more! Here's the DB5 from the Sean Connery era:

<div class="card-local-media">
{% responsiveImage, "content/personal/la-petersen-jb-db5.jpg", "" %}
</div>

The Lotus Esprit that turns into a submarine, from the Roger Moore years? Yep!

<div class="card-local-media">

</div>

How about the hero and villain cars from Pierce Brosnan's _Die Another Day_? Check!

</div>

As much as it pains me to see them like this, they also had some banged up (or straight-up wrecked) Aston Martins damaged during filming. The first one was used in the crash scene in Daniel Craig's _Casino Royale_:

</div>

### The Vault

The Vault - or "the basement where they keep all the cars not on display" - was easily the highlight of the visit. It's also, regrettably, the one part of the museum they don't allow visitors to take pictures, so I have nothing visual to show you. But I can recommend it. You get a guided tour of a lot of the cars, complete with backstories and history. And the stuff down there is pretty incredible: the original DeLorean from _Back to the Future_ (complete with interior design and flux capacitor!), the Batmobile, Herbie the Love Bug, a bunch of VIP limos, and much more. It's an extra fee, but well worth it.

And that's about all the cars I have. If you're a self-respecting gearhead, the Petersen is a _must-see._

## Thursday: the Kubecon after-party

A funny thing happens when you're having fun: you don't take many pictures! And the Kubecon afterparty was pretty fun. They had live music, good food, and games to play with your fellow attendees, including Jenga and Cornhole (featuring Jyotsna!)

</div>

Jyotsna and I also made a friend during the afterparty: Sai! He's an engineer from [solo.io](https://www.solo.io/) and we ended up grabbing drinks at the rooftop bar at his hotel (which ended up pretty close to ours).

## Friday: sunset at Malibu

Credit to Sai, he's more spontaneous than me! After we made friends, he invited Jyotsna and I to join him on a drive up north (in a convertible Mustang, no less!) to Malibu to watch the sunset. Quite a way to cap off our week!

<div class="card-local-media">

</div>

We left just after our last shift at the conference. It was 90+ degrees that day, so our first stop was ice cream at Salt and Straw, which was delicious - I got their seasonal "Halloween Candy" flavor:

<div class="card-local-media">

</div>

And then, we were on our way! The weather, good company, and open sky was pretty darn cool. (I'm on the left, Jyotsna is in the backseat, and Sai is driving.)

<div class="card-local-media">
{% responsiveImage, "content/personal/la-malibu-group.jpg", "" %}
</div>

About halfway to Malibu, I got a chance to drive the Mustang (and check something off my bucket list) - that's where the header is from!

<div class="card-local-media">
{% responsiveImage, "content/personal/la-malibu-group2.jpg", "" %}
</div>

Our first stop was the beach, where we dipped our toes in the water:

<div class="card-local-media">
{% responsiveImage, "content/personal/la-malibu-beach-laugh.jpg", "" %}
</div>

And finally: we watched the sunset from Point Dume. A fitting end for a spectacular week.

Phew... if you've made it this far, thanks for reading along!
