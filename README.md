# mbestavros.github.io: Personal Website

The repository for my personal Github Pages-hosted website. Uses Google's [Material Design Components for the Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) on top of [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/).

The site is very much a work-in-progress, and is constantly being changed and tweaked. I hope to use it as a playground to learn the basics of web dev.

## Running the site

This site is built on Node.JS; you will need that installed and working first.

Clone the repo. Then, install the site's dependencies with `npm install`.

Once that has finished, you can build and serve the site using `npm start`. You can access it by navigating to `localhost:8080` in the web browser of your choice.
