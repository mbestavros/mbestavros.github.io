                        <h3 class="resume-card__subtitle mdc-typography mdc-typography--body1">I've been playing
                            trombone since the fourth grade, and I continued playing it all the way through college. The
                            BU Pep Band was an absolute blast to be a part of. I haven't quite found an outlet for the
                            skill post-graduation, but I'm always on the lookout.</h3>

                        play on PC, and my favorites are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Skyrim -- not only do I play (a lot), I also write mods for it in my spare time.</li>
                            <li>Civilization (specifically V; though I own VI, I haven't gotten into it yet)</li>
                            <li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (silver for life!)</li>
                            <li>The Sims (on occasion, guilty pleasure)</li>
                            <li>Classic Need for Speed (Underground 2, Most Wanted, Carbon, ProStreet)</li>
                            <li>Forza (Motorsport and Horizon, though I prefer the latter)</li>
                        </ul>
                        Generally, if it's moddable, I'll probably enjoy it.

                    <h3 class="resume-card__subtitle mdc-typography mdc-typography--body1">I also follow Counter-Strike
                        esports quite closely. I owe that to the incredible 2018 Eleague Boston Major, which I was lucky
                        enough to attend live at Agganis Arena. The above picture is from just before the finals.</h3>

                        ultimate goal is to live somewhere on the MBTA's subway system and not have to own a car at all.

                        often, I find it fascinating to dig into the history of Boston's subway and read about the
