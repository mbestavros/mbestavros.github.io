                            since October 2018, when I joined as a part-time intern while finishing up my graduate
                            studies at Boston University. I moved to full-time in June 2019.</h3>
                        <h3 class="resume-card__subtitle mdc-typography mdc-typography--body1">I'm currently working on
                            Enarx, a project aiming to provide an abstraction layer across different implementations of
                            trusted execution environments (TEEs) from major hardware vendors, like Intel SGX and AMD
                            SEV. This will allow developers to write applications for third-party cloud vendors without
                            needing to trust the host's stack.</h3>
                        <h3 class="resume-card__subtitle mdc-typography mdc-typography--body1">The project's goal is to
                            make developing for TEEs not just easier, but more portable. You shouldn't need to rewrite
                            (or even recompile) your app for a different TEE.</h3>
                        <h3 class="resume-card__subtitle mdc-typography mdc-typography--body1">The project is fully
                            open-source and open-process: all our meetings and issue tracking are public, and you can
                            find out more at https://enarx.io.</h3>
