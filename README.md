# mbestavros.github.io: Personal Website

The repository for my personal Github Pages-hosted website. Uses Materialize.

The site is very much a work-in-progress, and is constantly being changed and tweaked. I hope to use it as a playground to learn the basics of web dev.

## Running the site

`npx gulp watch & npx eleventy --serve `
